# Logo Setup Instructions

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Colors Updated**: Using your exact color codes:
- Orange: `#DB8633` 
- Light Gray: `#BEBEBE`

‚úÖ **Logo Structure Ready**: Component updated to use actual images
‚úÖ **Styling Complete**: CSS matches your Figma design exactly

## To Add Your Actual Logo Images:

### Step 1: Save the Piggy Bank Logo
1. **Save your piggy bank image** as `piggy-logo.png` in the `public/` folder
2. **Recommended size**: 80x80px or larger (will scale automatically)
3. **Format**: PNG with transparency preferred
4. **Content**: Orange piggy bank with growing flowers/leaves

### Step 2: Verify the Setup
The component is now configured to:
- Display the piggy bank logo at the top
- Show "THRIVE INITIATIVE" with proper spacing
- Include the separator line below the brand name
- Display "Change4Good.org" with ".org" in your orange color

### Alternative: Use Different Filenames
If you prefer different filenames, update the src in `src/components/Login.tsx`:
```tsx
<img src="/your-piggy-logo.png" alt="Thrive Initiative Piggy Bank Logo" />
```

## Current Fallback
If no image is found, the component shows a piggy bank emoji (üê∑üå±) as a temporary placeholder.

## Design Features Implemented:
- ‚úÖ Exact color codes (`#DB8633` and `#BEBEBE`)
- ‚úÖ Separator line below "THRIVE INITIATIVE"
- ‚úÖ ".org" highlighted in your orange color
- ‚úÖ Proper spacing and typography
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Next Steps
Once you add your `piggy-logo.png` image, the login page will look exactly like your Figma design!
