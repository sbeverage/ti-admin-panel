# 🖼️ **How to Add Your Logo Images**

## **Step 1: Find the Public Folder**
Your project has a `public` folder at the root level. This is where you'll add your images.

## **Step 2: Add Your Images**
1. **Save your piggy bank logo** as `piggy-logo.png` in the `public` folder
2. **Save your text logo** as `text-logo.png` in the `public` folder

## **Step 3: File Structure**
Your `public` folder should look like this:
```
public/
├── piggy-logo.png     ← Your piggy bank logo
├── text-logo.png      ← Your "THRIVE INITIATIVE" text logo
├── favicon.ico
├── index.html
└── ... (other files)
```

## **Step 4: View Your Logos**
Once you add the images:
- **Piggy Bank**: Will appear at the top instead of 🐷🌱
- **Text Logo**: Will appear instead of the text version
- **Colors**: Will use your exact `#DB8633` orange and `#BEBEBE` gray

## **Image Requirements:**
- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Size**: Any size (will scale automatically)
- **Transparency**: PNG with transparency works best

## **What Happens:**
- ✅ **With images**: Shows your actual logos
- ❌ **Without images**: Shows emoji (🐷🌱) and text fallback

## **Quick Test:**
1. Add your images to the `public` folder
2. Refresh your browser at `http://localhost:3001`
3. You should see your logos instead of the emoji icons!
